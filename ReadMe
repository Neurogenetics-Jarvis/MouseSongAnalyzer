Mouse Song Analyzer is a MATLAB based GUI that aids in classifying mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs).

To run, simply launch whis_gui.m, a GUI window will pop up. Here you can set your parameters of how you would like to run the analysis.
In the mini file browser, navigate to the .wav files you would like to analyze. Multiple files may be selected.

Click "Get Sonograms"

A folder named 'sonograms' will be created one level above of where the .wav files are. 
WARNING: make sure you move or rename this folder before processing other files that are in folders at the same level or else 'sonograms' will be rewritten each time.
In the GUI, the file browser will now be in the newly created 'sonograms' folder.

Select the .sng files you would like processed and click "Process Sonograms"
-you mostly likely will need to select multiple .sng files at once. I've not been able to figure out why this is the case, but it runs into errors when only one file is selected and run.

Sonograms will now be processed and a browsable figure will pop up when each sonogram is processed. This allows you to view each USV that was categorized and under which category it was labeled.
Process Sonograms will also create three other files in the 'sonograms' folder with the AnimalID and SessionID substituted in the name of the files: AnimalID-SessionID-Notes.csv AnimalID-Session-ID-Syllables.csv and AnimalID-SessionID-Traces.mat

the Syllables.csv file can be processed with the Acoustic_Analysis_Guided_v1.1 written by Jonathan Chabout.

The Acoustic Analysis excel sheet is really clunky! Be warned it is slow and will be increasingly so with larger data sets. We're trying to get this written into a script (MATLAB or python), so stay tuned!
